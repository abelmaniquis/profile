  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>I like creating things and solving problems.After working in the Hospitality Industry as a night auditor for 4 years. It turns out that <a href ="http://time.com/3657434/night-work-early-death/">working rotating night shifts isn't exactly good for one's health,</a> so I have decided to pursue a career in technology as a Web Developer.</p>

 <h2>Where I'm from</h2>
  <p>I was born and in San Diego, California, and I have lived here all my life. I went to school at UC San Diego where I studied economics and math.</p>
    
 <p>   Because of my upbringing, there will always be a part of me that believes that the world would be a much better place if more people had access to the beach.

  <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <h3>
      Favorite Hobbies
    </h3>
      <p>
      I'm a classically trained guitarist who has also studied voice. I also like reading and weightlifting. Back when I was in shape, I used to dance salsa and box, and would like to be able to start doing those things again once I'm a little more settled in my career. I'd also like to really get back into Jiu Jitsu.
      </p>
  <h3>
      Favorite Music
  </h3>
    <p>
      I started my college career as a music major, so I have a lot of favorites. I tend to prefer listening to more technical musicians, and believe that there's room for a guitar solo or some kind of instrumental in every song.
    </p>
  <h3>
      Dream Job
  </h3>
    <p>
    I would like to have a career as a programmer or an actuary, and if neither of those plans work out, I plan on being the next Eddie Van Halen.
